# ðŸ“¸ Cross-Platform Photo Gallery App

Welcome to the repository for my cross-platform photo gallery app! This app allows users to browse photos, sort them by popularity or latest upload, and filter by category. The fetched data is cached on the device's local storage for 24 hours to improve performance.
